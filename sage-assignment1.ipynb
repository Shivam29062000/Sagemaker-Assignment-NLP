It won the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the 2015 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nSet in occupied France during World War II, the novel centers on a blind French girl and a German boy whose paths eventually cross. \\r\\nIn 1934, Marie-Laure LeBlanc is a six-year-old blind girl living in Paris with her father, the master locksmith at the Museum of Natural History. She hears stories of the purported Sea of Flames diamond hidden within the museum, which is said to grant immortality at the cost of endless misfortune to those around the owner. Allegedly, the only way to end the curse is to return the stone to the ocean, its rightful owner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Germany, 8-year-old Werner Pfennig is an orphan in the coal-mining town of Zollverein. Werner is exceptionally bright and has a natural skill for repairing radios and after he finds a broken one with his sister Jutta, he fixes it and he uses it to hear science and music programs transmitted across Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Germany invades France in 1940, Marie-Laure and her father flee to the coastal town of Saint-Malo to take refuge with her great-uncle Etienne, a recluse and shellshocked veteran of the Great War who spent his time broadcasting old records of his dead brother across Europe. Unknown to Marie-Laure, her father had been entrusted by the museum with either the Sea of Flames diamond or one of three exact copies, made to protect the original gem.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonths later, while building a model town of Saint-Malo for Marie-Laure, Marie-Laure\\'s father is arrested. He is not heard from again, leaving Marie-Laure alone with Etienne and Madame Manec, Etienne\\'s longtime maid and housekeeper. Meanwhile, a Nazi gemologist, Reinhold von Rumpel, begins to search for the Sea of Flames diamond, seeking its purported immortality, to save himself from dying an untimely death due to his spreading cancer. He locates each of the three forgeries, and sets his sights on Saint-Malo.\\r\\n\\r\\nWerner\\'s skill earns him a place at the National Political Institute of Education at Schulpforta, a draconian state boarding school teaching Nazi values. Werner is obedient and highly efficient in technical work. He begins work on radio technology and is soon placed in the Wehrmacht, tracking illegal enemy signals alongside Volkheimer, a large yet gentle soldier from Schulpforta. Werner becomes increasingly disillusioned with his position, especially after an innocent young girl is killed by his group after incorrectly tracing a signal. Sneaky Pete is an American crime drama series created by David Shore and Bryan Cranston. The series follows Marius JosipoviÄ\\x87 (Giovanni Ribisi), a released convict who adopts the identity of his cell mate, Pete Murphy, to avoid his past life. The series also stars Marin Ireland, Shane McRae, Libe Barer, Michael Drayer, Peter Gerety and Margo Martindale. The pilot debuted on August 7, 2015 and was followed by a full series order that September.[1] Shore left the project in early 2016 and was replaced by Graham Yost, who served as executive producer and showrunner for the remaining nine episodes.[2] The first season premiered in its entirety on January 13, 2017, exclusively on Amazon Prime Video.[3] On January 19, 2017, Amazon announced that Sneaky Pete had been renewed for a second season, which was released on March 9, 2018.[4][5] On July 28, 2018, Amazon announced that the series had been renewed for a third season, which was released on May 10, 2019.[6][7] On June 4, 2019, Amazon cancelled the series after three seasons.\\r\\nSneaky Pete follows \"Marius, a con man who gets out of prison only to find himself hunted by the vicious gangster he once robbed. With nowhere else to turn, Marius takes cover from his past by assuming the identity of his cellmate, Pete and then \"reunites\" with Pete\\'s estranged family â\\x80\\x94 who have no reason to suspect he is not their long-lost loved one\".'"
